Is this statement True or False? "By collecting more data, a firm has more scope to improve its products, which attracts more users, generating even more data, and so on."
Question 5Select one:

a.
True
Feedback: This is a quote from the Economist’ article [“Data is the new oil”](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data) and is generally accepted to be True.

b.
False
